                                <h2>Redefining Cool “Where Smooth Meets Smart”</h2>
                                <p>This is a workshop that is geared toward a younger audience between the
                                    ages of 13-18 that addresses the changes that are associated with the transition from being dependent to independent. It also deals with the importance of developing, and using basic life skills that will be necessary for a
                                    greater quality of life , security, confidence of self-reliance and, high self
                                    esteem. <br><br>
                                    Also addressed are, the excesses that the pop culture imposes on the
                                    young and vulnerable, and how to begin a more sophisticated quality of
                                    thinking that will minimize the negative effects that “over advertising “
                                    can have on a mind that has not been trained to identify certain signs. Open up with the following question <br><br>
                                    1. Which would you rather be a Living Zombie or a Master Teacher (M.T) ? </p><br><br>
                                    
                                    <p><strong> <span class="greencolor">Zombie Defined:</span></strong> One who is ignorant of their personal self-worth as well as inner workings of the society or culture that they are custom to. The same are also used economically by the
                                        more sophisticated elite at the zombies expense. <br><br>
                                        Also one whose intellect is dumbed down through exploitation of the pleasure principal which
                                        shuts down the analytical faculty of the brain resulting in them not realizing that they are incredible and truly represent 1 in a million, and are all connected at a quantum level. <br><br>
                                        Zombies don’t realize the importance of controlling their own thoughts and that they have the
                                        power and responsibility of creating the type of life that they desire and can do so if they wake
                                        up out the trance and make a concerted effort to prepare the mind for success through specialized knowledge. <br><br>
                                        <strong> <span class="greencolor">Teacher:</span></strong> One who has dedicated time effort and resources for the progressive purpose
                                        of increasing of one’s skill level as it relates to their occupation and interest. They have accumulated at least 7 consistent years of experience and are able to convey to an apprentice a wellrounded perspective of what is required to complete in an effective and efficient manner the task
                                        at hand..</p> <br><br>

                                    Energy Profile of Your Name</h2>
                                <p>In this workshop it is to establish that we are all energy in our essence or purest state, PEP is an acronym for Personal Energy Profile. This is an assessment of several different aspects of the person that takes a metaphysical approach to helping you understand
                                    your personality as well as your habit nature and why you do,
                                    what you do.

                                    <h2>MINDS WORK BEST OPEN!!</h2>
                                    <p> start from the beginning we would need to go back some 22,000 years to East Africa to an
                                    area that is called Mali and the inhabitants of this area which trace back some 350,000 years are
                                    called the Dogon Tribe.
                                    The Dogon are a people that are located in western Mali who have a fascinating history and ancestry that is associated with Egyptian and astronomy that dates backs 3200 BC. Now one of
                                    their primary claims are that the star Sirius has a companion star that cannot be seen. This
                                    smaller star is very dense in its make-up and has a 50 year rotating cycle around Sirius and it also
                                    has its own axis that maintains its path. </p> <br><br>

                                    <h2>To the letter</h2>
                                    <p>teaching from this point on will require you to suspend what you thought you knew about
                                    letters, numbers and words and begin to see them in terms of energy fields that are made up or
                                    represented by their symbols and definitions. </p> <br><br>

                                    <h2>Stages of awareness</h2>
                                    <p>There were some stages that I had to go through in digesting all of the information that is presented so depending on where you are in terms of what you have been exposed to will determine
                                    your rate of absorption and manner of comprehension.
                                    My basic approach to viewing a person is that you are perfect or complete in your current state,
                                    in that you have everything in you to actualize what you came here to do or your purpose.</p>
                                    <br><br>

                                    <h2>Sounds Are a Form of a Vibration</h2> <p>
Sounds are a form of a vibration and have an effect within your energy organic universe that you
call a life. This alive or organic universe is responsive to certain vibrations as is your body responsive to the like.
These vibrations are shaping the way you see your world and what you will gravitate to or will
be interested in and hence the decisions you will be making.</p> <br><br>

<h2>Influences</h2> <p>
We are heavily influenced by the things we were exposed to at our most impressionable stages
of life particularly from the ages of 3-12 because of the rate of vibration that the brain resonates
at during this period of time. It is at this time in our lives that many of the foundational world
views that we currently have were programmed in us and influencing our thoughts and the world
that we set out to create.</p> <br><br>

<h2>How to Read the Energy In a Word</h2>  <p>
In a nut shell each letter in the alphabet has a specific set of characteristic that are dominant and
this letter, symbol sound, and vibration produces the characteristic in the person. This is why it

                                 Because success only comes to the mind that has been prepared for it, and it just doesn’t happen
                                 by chance nor by the size of their shoe but only through purposed preparation of the child’s mind with constant conscious subtle comments that are directed with intention and the parent speaking them realizes the importance of EVERY WORD coming out of their mouth.</p> <br><br>
